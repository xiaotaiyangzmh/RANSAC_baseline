*Plane Seg* is a library for fitting planes to LIDAR, depth camera data or elevation maps. It uses robust estimation to fit planes by clustering planar points with similar normals.

We assume the ROS build system (e.g. Melodic). The core library (plane-seg) is only dependent on PCL. The ROS application (plane-seg-ros) can process PointCloud2 and GridMap data types.

The edge detection package depends on Rviz Visual Tools and on the Locomotion Viewer library.

# Using It

**Run-Time Application:** A sample application (for ANYmal) can be run and visualized (in Rviz) as follows:

```python
roslaunch plane_seg_ros anymal.launch
roslaunch plane_seg_ros view_plane_seg.launch
```

**Test program:** reads example point clouds (PCDs), processes them and executes the fitting algorithm:

```python
roslaunch plane_seg_ros test.launch
roslaunch plane_seg_ros view_plane_seg.launch
```

**Run edge detection:** 
```python
rosrun edge_detection_ros edge_detection_ros
```

# Input

Input should be a point cloud or elevation map in the robot's odometry frame as well as the pose of the robot
in the odometry frame. The elevation map is assumed to be at a 1-2 Hz.

# Output

1) A series of planar convex hulls published to ROS at 1-2 Hz

* Nov 2019: Existing limitation is that the code searches for plane regions (which works fine), but that these regions are then assumed to be convex. However, they could be concave. We need to instead break concave regions into convex ones - a basic task.

2) A series of line segments (edges) of published to ROS at 1-2 Hz. The minimum lenght of the edges can be adjusted, as much as the minimum height required to detect a new step.

# Performance

* The ANYmal RGB-D (RealSense D435) elevation map is 2cm resolution with 18000 points. It takes 0.3 seconds to process.
* The DRC LIDAR terrain scan below is very dense with 76000 points. It takes 2.5 seconds to process.
